* `Lab2.sol` - marketplace implementation in Solidity. You can create, buy, transfer and check your tokens there. It is deployed at Ropsten - `0xcB72916261E86Abcb66b2c776B5cEa9BEF0ca8f7`
* `lab2.html` - simple html+js frontend for the marketplace

On this marketplace you can check available assets:

If you want to gift your asset, you can specify the address and send the ownership:

And the new owner can check that it is now theirs:
